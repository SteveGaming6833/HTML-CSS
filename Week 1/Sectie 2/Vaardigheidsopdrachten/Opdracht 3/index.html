    <h1>Super Mario 64 v2</h1>
    <p>
      Super Mario 64 is a 3D platformer in which the player controls Mario
      through various courses. Mario's abilities are far more diverse than in
      previous games. He can walk, run, jump, crouch, crawl, climb, swim, kick,
      grab objects, and punch using the game controller's analog stick and
      buttons. He can also execute special jumps by combining a regular jump
      with other actions, including the double and triple jumps, long jump,
      backflip, and wall jump. The player can also adjust the camera—operated by
      a Lakitu broadcasting Mario—and toggle between first-person and
      third-person view.
      <br /><br />
      The hub world takes place in Princess Peach's Castle, which consists of
      three floors, a tower, and a basement, plus a moat and a courtyard outside
      the castle. The player's main objective is to look for paintings that
      bring them to courses containing Power Stars, which upon their collection
      unlock more of the castle hub world. Each of the fifteen courses has seven
      Power Stars, and an additional fifteen are hidden as secrets and as
      bonuses, for a total of 120 Power Stars in the entire game. The courses
      are filled with enemies as well as friendly creatures that provide
      assistance or ask favors, such as Bob-omb Buddies, who will allow Mario to
      access cannons on request. Some Power Stars only appear after completing
      certain tasks, often hinted at by the name of the course. These challenges
      include collecting one hundred yellow coins or eight red coins on a stage,
      defeating a boss, racing an opponent, and solving puzzles. The final level
      of the game is blocked by "endless stairs", but Mario can bypass them by
      collecting seventy Power Stars. There are many hidden mini-courses and
      other secrets within the castle, which may contain extra Power Stars
      required for the full completion of the game. If the player returns to the
      game after collecting all 120 Power Stars, Yoshi can be found on the roof
      of Princess Peach's Castle, who will give the player a message from the
      developers, accompanied by one hundred extra lives and an improved triple
      jump.

      The game begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come
      to her castle for a cake she has baked for him. When he arrives, Mario
      discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess
      and her servants within it using the power of the castle's 120 Power
      Stars. The Power Stars are hidden in the castle's paintings, which serve
      as portals to other worlds where Bowser's minions keep watch over the
      Stars. Mario explores the castle and enters these worlds, gaining access
      to more rooms as he recovers more Stars. Twice in his adventure, Mario
      unlocks doors to different floors of the castle with keys obtained by
      defeating Bowser in hidden worlds. He gets at least seventy of the 120
      Stars, breaking the curse of the endless stairs that block the entrance to
      Bowser's final hiding place. After Mario defeats Bowser in the final
      battle, he obtains a special Power Star which gives him the Wing Cap, and
      he flies back to the castle. Peach is then released from the stained-glass
      window above the castle's entrance, and she rewards Mario by kissing him
      on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him.
