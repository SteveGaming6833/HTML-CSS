          i'm tired of seeing it, my friends on TikTok send me <b>BALLER</b>
          <br />
          on Discord's fuckin' <b>BALLER</b>.
          <br />
          i was at studio origami right? and all the channels were just <b>BALLER</b>
          <br />
          I sold my Superscuffle art to my girlfriend- (bro you don't even have
          a damn girlfriend, stop the cap.)
          <br />
          <i>((and then- and then i downloaded it and said))</i> -hey babe, when the...
          <b>BALLER</b> is <b>BALLER</b>, HAHAA!
          <br />
          <i><u>(two kazoo covers of Better Call Saul theme played simultaneously)</u></i>
          <br />
          i fucking looked at a guest avatar, and said, "that's a bit <b>BALLER</b>"
          <br />
          i look at my penis, i think of a peanut, and i go "penis? more like <b>BALLER</b>", AAAAAAA-

            >I think it's disgusting that somebody used my blindfolded SM64 run
            and passed it off as a TAS to re-record themselves reacting to it.
            He also conveniently put his cam right over mine so you can't see me
            eating coke and drinking pizza at the same time. These
            "speedrunners" aka cheaters are getting out of hand. Thanks to my
            friend who told me about this blatant thievery of my OC.
            <u>Thanks Badabun.</u></b
